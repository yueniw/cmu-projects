With dataset provided by capital bikeshare company, we want to build as effective model to predict the availability of 
bikes at each station during specific period of time for their users. The solution was to build a 
random forest model and a XGBoost model using cleaned data subset from raw dataset to 
evaluate their performance using AIC and BIC values. The benefit is that the algorithm is 
developed, easy to use and easy to reproduce.
